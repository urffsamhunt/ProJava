Question 1

A sentence in the Special Fashion can be printed by taking two integers (not beyond
 total number of words in the sentence or less than 1). These integers tell the word number of the
 sentence. Replace only those words present at those given integer places by the next character in
 a circular fashion according to the English Alphabets. If both the integers are same then replace
 only one word. let us consider the following examples:
 Input Sentence: He has good Books.
 Input Integers: 2, 4
 Output Sentence: He ibt good Cpplt.
 (i.e. word number 2 and 4 have been replaced by the next characters in a circular fashion)
 Input Sentence: Time and tide waits for
 Input Integers: 3, 3
 Output Sentence: Time and ujef waits for none.
 Write a case sensitive program that reads a sentence from console (the characters of the sentence
 may be capital or small or mixed) and two positive integers and output the same sentence after
 replacing those words present at those given integer places by the next character in a circular
 fashion according to the English Alphabets.
 In the first example given above, word number 2, i.e. “has” is replaced by next characters and
 hence it becomes “ibt”. Similarly, word number 4, i.e. “Books” is replaced by next characters
 and hence it becomes “Cpplt”.

 Question 2

 Write a java program to find out a given matrix is sparse matrix or not. Sparse
  matrix contains zero elements above a certain threshold. This threshold is given by (n*m)/2,
  where n and m are the rows and columns in matrix. Hence, if a matrix contains more than n*m/2
  number of zeros it is sparse matrix otherwise not.
  Enter the dimensions of the matrix:
  2 3

  Enter the elements of the matrix:
  1 0 0
  2 1 1

  The matrix is not a sparse matrix
  Enter the dimensions of the matrix:
  3 4
  Enter the elements of the matrix:
  1 0 0 0
  1 0 0 0
  1 0 0 0

  The matrix is a sparse matrix

  Question 3

  Write a program to accept the year, month and the weekday name of the 1st day of
   that month and generate its calendar.
   Example :
   INPUT : 
   Year : 2016
   Month : February
   1st day of February : Monday

   OUTPUT :
   -------------------------------------------
                 February 2016
   -------------------------------------------
   SUN    MON   TUE   WED   THU   FRI   SAT
   -------------------------------------------
           1      2    3     4     5     6
   -------------------------------------------
    7      8      9    10    11    12    13
   -------------------------------------------
    14     15     16   17    18    19    20
   -------------------------------------------
    21     22     23   24    25    26    27
   -------------------------------------------
    28     29
   -------------------------------------------

   Question 4

   Write a program to accept a date in the string format dd/mm/yyyy and accept
    the name of the day on 1st of January of the corresponding year. Find the day for the given
    date
    Example:
    INPUT:
    Date : 5/7/2001
    Day on 1st January : MONDAY
    OUTPUT: Day on 5/7/2001 : THURSDAY

    Question 5

    Write a Program in Java to input a number and check whether it is
     a Fascinating Number or not..
     Fascinating Numbers : Some numbers of 3 digits or more exhibit a very interesting
     property. The property is such that, when the number is multiplied by 2 and 3, and both
     these products are concatenated with the original number, all digits from 1 to 9 are present
     exactly once, regardless of the number of zeroes.

     Let’s understand the concept of Fascinating Number through the following example:
     Consider the number 192,
     192 x 1 = 192
     192 x 2 = 384
     192 x 3 = 576
     Concatenating the results : 192384576
     It could be observed that ‘192384576’ consists of all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.
     Hence, it could be concluded that 192 is a Fascinating Number.Some examples of
     fascinating Numbers are : 192, 219, 273, 327, 1902, 1920, 2019 etc.
